## Structured Illumination Microscopy Experiments

This repo is used to keep track of code that used to test tiled SIM reconstruction on data acquired with a low NA cryogenic 3D structured illumination SIM. 

This code base is a derivative of Mats Gustafsson & Lin Shao's 3-beam SIM reconstruction software. 

The algorithm as described in [Gustafsson et al (2008) Biophys. J. 94(12): 4957â€“4970. doi: 10.1529/biophysj.107.120345](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2397368/)

There is also a sophisticated Python wrapper, written by [David Hoffman](https://github.com/david-hoffman) which implements a tiled version of simrecon.

James Seyforth and Brian Northan also made the following contributions

1.  Organized code into one project, added CMake support and added to github repo. 
2.  Better documentation of code organization and build process.
3.  More sophisticated threading to avoid thread resource contention. 
4.  Misc. fixes for some crash scenarios (long file names)
5.  Added a number of notebooks to analyze and troubleshoot results and PSF. 
6.  Added a notebook that uses Napari to visualize results and parameters at each tile location. 
7.  Added constraints to tiled reconstruction to handle occasional invalid results at a tile (this allowed us to experiment with smaller tiles).
8.  Added keeporder2 mode (more emphasis on order2 information) and ran several tests with 'nofilteroverlaps' mode. 
9.  Added new notebooks and scripts for processing.
